# weather-station
Using the OpenWeather API, I've created a comparison between my home made weather detector and the actual weather in Austin. 

## Features
- Fetch current weather data for a specified city.
- Fetch weather forecast for the next few days.
- Compare weather API data with local temperature sensor data.
- Displays data like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `requests` library for making API calls.
- `dotenv` library for loading environment variables.
- **OpenWeather API Key** (you need to sign up and get your API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ehgbl/weather-station.git
